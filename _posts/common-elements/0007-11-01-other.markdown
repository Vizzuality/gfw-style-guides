There are also other common elements used in the GFW website, such as pagination, accordions or loading spinners.

### Pagination

When the content is too long for a single page (for example, when showing a list of articles or results for a search),
pagination should be used. This element allows the user to browse between pages and always know where they are.

This is how they look when the user is on different pages:

![alt text][other-pagination]

### Accordion

Accordions are used when there is a lot of information in one page and is not necessary to show everything at the same time.
They are useful to keep the page from being too long.

### Spinner

When the content in a page is loading, the user must receive some feedback to know that something is actually happening.
In this case, a spinner graphic is used:

![alt text][spinner]
