Forms are composed of text fields, text areas, selectors, radio buttons, and more. These elements are designed
to allow building a new form fast and easy.

### Text field

![alt text][text-field]

Text fields are used when we need a text input from the user. It can be accompanied by these elements:

* **Label**: Placed over the text field, it is its title.
* **Placeholder**: It displays in the text field until the user writes something there. It usually suggests
    what kind of information the user is expected to input.
* **Hint**: It adds information about the field, usually requirements or instructions.

</div>

### Code

<div id="code-snippet-box1" class="code-snippet-box">
  {% include code-snippet.html htmlcode="snippets/common-elements/forms/text-field.html" csscode="snippets/common-elements/forms/text-field-css.html" %}
</div>

### Text area

![alt text][text-area]

Text areas are useful when the amount of information asked for is bigger than what would fit in a regular
text field (e.g. comments, opinions, etc.)

### Code

<div id="code-snippet-box2" class="code-snippet-box">
  {% include code-snippet.html htmlcode="snippets/common-elements/forms/text-area.html" csscode="snippets/common-elements/forms/text-area-css.html" %}
</div>

### File select

![alt text][file-select]

This element is used in forms where the user is asked to upload files from their computer. When the file selection
button is pressed, the browser’s file explorer opens allowing the user to choose the files.

The **description** is used to add some information or instructions to the form element. It can also be used with text fields,
text areas, etc.

### Code

<div id="code-snippet-box3" class="code-snippet-box">
  {% include code-snippet.html htmlcode="snippets/common-elements/forms/file-select.html" csscode="snippets/common-elements/forms/file-select-css.html" %}
</div>

<a class="btn btn--download" download="forms.zip" href="{{site.url}}gfw-style-guides/downloads/common-elements/forms/forms.zip">download</a>

### Submit Button

![alt text][button]

Every form needs a submit button so the user can send the information to the server. Use a primary button for this.



### Others elements

Elements like checkboxes or radio buttons use the default styles from the browser to avoid compatibility issues.
