Forms are composed of text fields, text areas, selectors, radio buttons, and more. These elements are designed
to allow building a new form fast and easy.

### Text field

![alt text][text-field]

Text fields are used when we need a text input from the user. It can be accompanied by these elements:

* **Label**: Placed over the text field, it is its title.
* **Placeholder**: It displays in the text field until the user writes something there. It usually suggests
    what kind of information the user is expected to input.
* **Hint**: It adds information about the field, usually requirements or instructions.

### Text area

![alt text][text-area]

Text areas are useful when the amount of information asked for is bigger than what would fit in a regular
text field (e.g. comments, opinions, etc.)

### File select

![alt text][file-select]

This element is used in forms where the user is asked to upload files from their computer. When the file selection
button is pressed, the browserâ€™s file explorer opens allowing the user to choose the files.

The **description** is used to add some information or instructions to the form element. It can also be used with text fields,
text areas, etc.

### Submit Button

![alt text][submit-button]

Every form needs a submit button so the user can send the information to the server. Use a primary button for this.

### Others elements

Elements like checkboxes or radio buttons use the default styles from the browser to avoid compatibility issues.
