Use these styles to display listed information.

### Simple list

### Card list

![alt text][card-list]

A **card list** is much more visually appealing than a simple list, and allows you to show icons,
buttons, etc. for each item.

Cards can also display text when the cursor is hovering them.

### Country list

A **country list** is a mosaic of countries with their shape and name. The mobile adaptation
changes the layout to a vertical list.
