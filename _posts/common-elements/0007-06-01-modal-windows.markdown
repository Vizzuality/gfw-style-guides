Modal windows are used to display information over other content. It hijacks the screen, not allowing
the user to interact with the rest of the page until closed. It is very useful to show extra information
that is not displayed in the main page but is related to it.

<a class="btn btn--preview" target="_blank" href="{{site.url}}gfw-style-guides/downloads/common-elements/modal-window/index.html">preview</a>
<a class="btn btn--download" download="modal-window.zip" href="{{site.url}}gfw-style-guides/downloads/common-elements/modal-window/modal-window.zip">download</a>

![alt text][modal]

### Code

<div id="code-snippet-box1" class="code-snippet-box">
  {% include code-snippet.html htmlcode="snippets/common-elements/modal-windows/modal-windows-html.html" csscode="snippets/common-elements/modal-windows/modal-windows-css.html" %}
</div>


The modal windows in mobile devices don't overlap the rest of the content but substitute it.
