The icons used in the GFW website must follow a simple set of rules to keep a coherent visual style.

* **Keep it simple**: Avoid designing icons too complex
* **Use just one color**: Donâ€™t use gradients or more than one color in the icons
* **Avoid outlined icons**: Solid icons are preferred

Icons can be highlighted inverting their color and placing them in a green circle.
This makes them stand out among the rest of the content of the page:

It is also common to give them a different color when hovering with the cursor:
