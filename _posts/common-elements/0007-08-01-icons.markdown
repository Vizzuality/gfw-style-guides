The icons used in the GFW website must follow a simple set of rules to keep a coherent visual style.

* **Keep it simple**
* **Use just one color**
* **Avoid outlined icons**: Solid icons are preferred

![alt text][icons]

Icons can be highlighted inverting their color and placing them in a green circle.
This makes them stand out among the rest of the content of the page:

![alt text][icons-big]

It is also common to give them a different color when hovering with the cursor:

![alt text][icons-hover]
