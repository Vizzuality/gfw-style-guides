When designing an external application, please take the GFW website style guidelines in consideration.

* **Keep it clean and simple**: The application must be easy to use and visually appealing. Avoid clutter and overdecoration.
* **Make sure that things are aligned**: Remember to follow the grid of the rest of the site.
* **Use the correct fonts, text sizes and icon styles**: Visit the related sections of this guideline for more details.
* **Use the common elements if you need them**: Donâ€™t reinvent the wheel.
