The sidebar is a structural element that is used in conjunction with the main content module.
It is placed on its left, and usually holds tabs to switch between different content.

The sidebar is 260px wide. The content, on the other hand, is flexible and adapts its width to the size of the screen.

### Responsive

The sidebar’s behaviour changes when the site is accessed from a mobile device. The sidebar acts as a
standalone menu taking all the width of the screen, while the main content is hidden. Tapping on one of the
options makes the content of that tab unfold.
