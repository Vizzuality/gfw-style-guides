There are 6 main structural elements in the GFW website: toolbar, navigation bar, header, content,
related content and footer. Each page of the site is built using them.

### Home and second level pages

Home and secondary pages always have a toolbar, nav bar and header. The main content is situated under them,
with a related content module usually underneath. The last thing in the page is the footer.

Secondary pages often have a sidebar with tabs next to the main content. This sidebar is situated on the left
side of the page, with a width of 260px.

### Other pages

Even though every page has at least a toolbar, navigation bar and content, the rest of the elements are optional and
their use depend on the content displayed. For example, the map section doesnâ€™t have scroll, so the header, related
content and footer modules are not shown to maximize space availability.
