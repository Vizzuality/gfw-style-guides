There are 6 main structural elements in the GFW website: toolbar, navigation bar, header, content,
related content and footer. Each page of the site is built using them.

### Home and second level pages

Home and secondary pages always have a toolbar, nav bar and header. The main content is situated under them,
with a related content module usually underneath. The last thing in the page is the footer.

Secondary pages often have a sidebar with tabs next to the main content. This sidebar is situated on the left
side of the page, with a width of 260px.

### Other pages

Even though every page has at least a toolbar, navigation bar and content, the rest of the elements are optional and
their use depend on the content displayed. For example, the map section doesn’t have scroll, so the header, related
content and footer modules are not shown to maximize space availability.
