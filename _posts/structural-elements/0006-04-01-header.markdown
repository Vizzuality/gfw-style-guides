The header is the part of the page where the section title and introduction is located.
It is dark and distinctive, and it usually holds the most important calls to action.

<div id="code-snippet-box1" class="code-snippet-box">
  {% include code-snippet.html htmlcode="snippets/structural-elements/header/header.html" csscode="snippets/structural-elements/header/header-css.html" %}
</div>

Remember: The GFW logo from the navigation bar overlaps the header, so the top padding must be
70px to avoid it stepping on the main title. The height of the header varies depending on its content.

### The header in the home

When used in the home of the GFW website, the header element works as a slideshow of the featured sections
and news of the site. In this specific case, the header is placed directly beneath the navigation bar, showing
slightly through it. The height of this header is always 500px.
