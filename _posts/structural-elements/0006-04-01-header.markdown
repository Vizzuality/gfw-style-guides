The header is the part of the page where the section title and introduction is located.
It is dark and distinctive, and it usually holds the most important calls to action.

Remember: The GFW logo from the navigation bar overlaps the header, so the top padding must be
70px to avoid it stepping on the main title. The height of the header varies depending on its content.

### The homepage header

When used in the homepage of the GFW website, the header element works as video introduction about GFW and its mission. In this specific case, a button is displayed to pause or play the background video.
