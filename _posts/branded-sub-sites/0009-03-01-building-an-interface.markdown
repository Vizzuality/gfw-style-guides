When designing an new application or branded sub-site, please take the GFW website style guidelines in consideration.

* ***Keep it clean and simple***: The application must be easy to use and visually appealing. Avoid clutter and overdecoration.
* ***Make sure that things are aligned***: Remember to follow the grid of the rest of the site.
* ***Use the correct fonts, text sizes and icon styles***: Visit the related sections of this guideline for more details.
* ***Use the common elements if you need them***: Donâ€™t reinvent the wheel.

For example, when creating a map-based application, the mobile version should follow a structure similar to this to maintain
a coherent user experience across applications:
