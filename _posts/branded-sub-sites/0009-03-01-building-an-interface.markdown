When designing a new application or branded sub-site, please take the GFW style guidelines into consideration.

* ***Keep it clean and simple***: The application must be easy to use and visually appealing. Avoid clutter and overdecoration.
* ***Make sure that things are aligned***: Remember to follow the grid of the rest of the site.
* ***Use the correct fonts, text sizes and icon styles***: Visit the related sections of this guideline for more details.
* ***Use the common elements if you need them***: Donâ€™t reinvent the wheel.

### Type

The typography used should be the same as in the rest of the platform: Fira Sans.

Font size may vary depending on the place where text is used (smaller in reduced panels, bigger in text boxes).
Capitalization is suggested in small titles such as categories, panel titles, etc.

### Icons

There are many assets designed for well defined functions. Using the same visual cues among applications helps the users understand them easily.

### Maps guidelines for mobile

The responsive adaptations in every application and sub-site must follow the same patterns explained in previous sections of this guide.

For example, when creating a map-based application, the mobile version should follow a structure similar to this to maintain
a coherent user experience across applications:
