### Logo

The GFW logo can be adapted and extended to create new derivative logos for applications and branded sub-sites.

![logo][logo]

* ***Color***: For legibility reasons, the color chosen for the application should have enough
contrast and work well behind white and black text.
* ***Name text***: The type used in the logo is Arial Bold Condensed. Letter spacing and font size
of the application name should be set so that its width matches the rest of the composition.

### Color palette

GFW uses a distinctive color palette as a part of our visual identity. You can expand the color palette adding colors
with similar hue and luminosity. Please make sure that the colors work well when placing white or black text over it.
