The Global Forest Watch website uses four main templates to create all of its pages. They all share
some structural elements but each one has its own features.

![alt text][home-template]

![alt text][content-template]

![alt text][directory-template]

![alt text][story-template]

Learn more about these templates and when to use them in the next pages.
