The content template is the most common template used in the site. Content pages are based on them.

### Desktop

The main elements of the content template are a header, a content module (usually with a sidebar),
a related content module, and the footer.

### Responsive

In this case, the mobile adaptation changes the way the page behaves. When a tab is selected, the content
related to that tab substitutes the content displayed, hiding the logo, the header, footer, etc. The user can
get back to the main content page tapping the top link.
