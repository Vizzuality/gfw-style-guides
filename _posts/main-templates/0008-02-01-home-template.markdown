This template is used exclusively in the websiteâ€™s home page. Its main function is to showcase some
featured and important sections to the new user while explaining what the website is all about.

### Desktop

The desktop home template has a huge carousel showcasing some of the featured content in the site, followed by
quick links to other sections and applications, a Recent Activity module and the footer.
