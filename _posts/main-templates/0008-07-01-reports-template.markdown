Reports allow the user to consult different metrics for a country or region, compare those indicators for two or more countries, customize them and print the results.

### Desktop

The single country report has a header with the basic country data, followed by a content section formed by series of blocks displaying the different indicators. They may contain charts, highlighted text, maps, etc. These reports are customizable, so the user can add and delete indicators to generate the one that best fits their needs.

  </a>
</div>

These reports can also be comparative, displaying indicators from up to three countries in an easy to read format. The header in this case contains the countries selectors, and the content block is divided in two or three columns, each one for each country.

The indicators for each country are displayed on the same level, allowing fast consulting and easy comparing.
