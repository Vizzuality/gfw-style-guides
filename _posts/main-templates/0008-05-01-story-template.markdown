Crowdsourced stories use a special type of template with a white header background and a new
module for related stories.

### Desktop

The content module in this template allows for an image slideshow on top, as well as a circular map to
contextualize the story. The text is laid out in two columns and it is slightly bigger than the one used
in the rest of the templates to improve legibility and give the stories a more editorial visual style.

The header has a white background for the same reason.
