When designing and developing third party external applications, a mention to Global Forest Watch should be included.

* ***In websites***: The GFW logo must be inserted on the footer in websites using Global Forest Watch data.
This logo must link to the Global Forest Watch website. Please follow the guidelines regarding  **[Logo][logo]** usage.
* ***In maps and complex interfaces***: Instead of inserting the whole logo, please include a text on the bottom giving
credit to Global Forest Watch. “Powered by Global Forest Watch” or “Data provided by Global Forest Watch” is suggested.
That text must link to the Global Forest Watch website.

### Examples of brand usage

Depending on the design of the application, the GFW attribution could be placed in a number of different places.
